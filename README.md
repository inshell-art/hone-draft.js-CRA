# Hone

Hone is a text editor to help you as a indivual to write you idea, polish it, and firm it.
Human's ideas start from rough, sensitive, through repeatation for many times, until to be the solid principle for self, and once it ends, people will say the idea is inherent that means the guy won't change it in the furture.

The project is inspired by:

- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/): the modes switching.
- [notion](https://www.notion.so/): the block.
- [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): the double bracket link.
- [dayOne](https://dayoneapp.com/): the journal daily to create scenarios to polish ideas.
- [iaWriter](https://ia.net/writer): the focus mode.
